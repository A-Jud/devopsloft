Participation is 'DevOps Loft', a community which drives my career path into DevOps.
The community mission is transfering DevOps knowledge by pracitice. We are implementing an open source web app (www.devopsloft.io), while picking up DevOps technologies, like: git (GitHub), AWS, Linux, scripting, Chef/Ansible.
